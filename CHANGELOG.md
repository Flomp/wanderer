# v0.14.0
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This release introduces significant updates, including the migration of the frontend to [Svelte 5](https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-5-is-alive). While the migration has been rigorously tested, there is a possibility that some features may not function as expected. We encourage you to report any issues you encounter. Additionally, the location search functionality has been transitioned from a locally hosted meilisearch index to nominatim. This upgrade offers substantially improved location search capabilities within wanderer. As a result, the custom meilisearch docker image (`flomp/wanderer-search`) is now deprecated. You can safely replace it with the official meilisearch image (`getmeili/meilisearch:v1.11.3`) in your `docker-compose.yml`.

## Maintenance
- Migrates to Svelte 5
- Removes the cities500 index from meilisearch

> [!CAUTION]
This release contains breaking changes. Most migrations will happen automatically, but you will need to take action in two places that will be clearly marked ⚠️ further down.

## Maintenance
- Updates to meilisearch version 0.11.3. 
- ⚠️ meilisearch indices are not compatible across minor versions. This means you will need to rename or delete your [`data.ms`](https://github.com/Flomp/wanderer/blob/8635de78b9f1510e2316b08e605b175a2615f4db/docker-compose.yml#L19) folder on your host system to force meilisearch to rebuild the index on the next start (note that this can take a little while). 

## Features
- Adds password reset email function for users (see [docs](https://wanderer.to/guides/authentication/#forgot-your-password) for more info)
- You can now add photos to your summit logs
- Complete rewrite of the map logic switching from raster to vector tiles

⚠️ Custom raster tilesets added via `Settings -> Display -> Tilesets` will no longer work. You will have to delete them for the map to show correctly. Tileset URLs must now point to a valid `style.json` describing a vector tileset (see [docs](https://wanderer.to/guides/customize-map/#custom-map-styles) for more info).
- 3D Terrain and Hillshading are now available (see [docs](https://wanderer.to/guides/customize-map/#terrain--hillshading) fore more info)
- Adds two more default map styles: CARTO Light & Dark
- Adds loading animations for trail lists

## Bug fixes

- Fixes bug that caused a new trail to be created instead of updated when uploading a new GPS data source to an existing trail
- Fixes bug that caused trails to throw a 404 error when they had summit logs created before v0.11.0
- Waypoint markers can now also be dragged after a trail was saved
- Fixes issue with GPX export when using Google Chrome (thanks [@tofublock](https://github.com/tofublock))
