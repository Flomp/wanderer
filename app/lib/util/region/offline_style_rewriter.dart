/// Rewrites a downloaded trail's MapLibre style so it resolves entirely from

/// Given the online base style, the app-wide glyph/sprite cache [cacheRoot]
/// (`<app-docs>/map_cache`) and the trail's downloaded
/// `.pmtiles` [cellPaths], this pure transform:
///
///  * points `glyphs` at `file://<cacheRoot>/glyphs/{fontstack}/{range}.pbf`
///    (the literal `{fontstack}`/`{range}` tokens are preserved for native
///    runtime substitution);
///  * points `sprite` at `file://<cacheRoot>/sprite/<light|dark>`;
///  * repoints every remote (tiled) vector/raster source at a native
///    `pmtiles://file://` archive using [cellPaths];
///  * special-cases any `type: raster-dem` source (e.g. `hillshadeSource`) —
///    it is routed to its own [demCellPaths] archive instead, and gains
///    `encoding: terrarium` + `tileSize: 512` + a dedicated
///    [_proxyDemMaxZoom], all three of which the online style relies on
///    Mapterhorn's tilejson to supply and therefore does not carry itself.
///    When [demCellPaths] is empty, the raster-dem source and every layer
///    that references it are dropped entirely (hillshade is cosmetic, so a
///    trail with no downloaded DEM archive just renders without relief —
///    it must never leak the source's `https://` url into the offline
///    style).
///
/// ## Multi-cell strategy
///
/// A single trail's offline tiles are split across one `.pmtiles` archive per
/// 0.5° grid cell (`db/services/tiles/generator.go` runs `pmtiles extract` per
/// `grid.go` `GridSize = 0.5`, so a realistic trail spans ~1-4 cells). The
/// installed `pmtiles` 1.2.0 Dart package is **read-only** (`PmTilesArchive`
/// exposes only `from`/`fromFile`/`fromReadAt` — no write/merge API), and a
/// server-side merge endpoint is out of this Flutter phase's scope. So a
/// client-side or download-time merge is infeasible; instead this transform
/// emits **N native `pmtiles://file://` sources + N duplicated style-layer
/// sets**: the first cell keeps the original source key, each extra cell `i`
/// gets a `<source>-cell-<i>` source and a `<layerId>__cell<i>` clone of every
/// layer that referenced that source. Source-less layers (e.g. `background`)
/// are never cloned. This is bounded by `cellPaths.length` (realistic cell
/// counts are small; `is_large` full-polyline trails are deferred).
///
/// ## Path safety
///
/// Every emitted URL is rooted at the supplied [cacheRoot] / [cellPaths] and
/// carries only the `file://` or `pmtiles://file://` scheme. Any `cellPath` or
/// `cacheRoot` that is not absolute, contains a `..` traversal segment, or
/// carries a foreign URL scheme is rejected with an [ArgumentError] before any
/// path enters the style — a downloaded trail can never read outside the
/// app sandbox, and no `https://` URL is ever produced for the offline style.
///
/// The input [style] is deep-copied before any mutation, so the shared online
/// base JSON (from the `keepAlive` style provider) is never corrupted.
