:::caution
This release contains breaking changes. They are marked with a ⚠️.  
**Please update to version v0.16.5 first before updating to v0.17.0.**
:::

### Configuration
Check the reopsitory's [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/Flomp/wanderer/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) for a valid configuration.

- ⚠️ The PocketBase environment variable `POCKETBASE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is now required. It requires a valid 32 character AES key as its value. To generate a key, run `openssl rand -hex 16`.
- ⚠️ The PocketBase environment variable `ORIGIN`is now required. It must be set to the public IP or hostname (including the port) of your wanderer frontend and must equal the value set for the frontend's `ORIGIN` environment variable.

### Features
- Adds federation
- Adds rich text editor for descriptions and comments
  
### Docs
- Adds documentation for federation
- Restructures the documentation in three distinct parts (for users, admins & developers) for better separation of concerns

### Translation

## v0.14.0
:::note
This release introduces significant updates, including the migration of the frontend to Svelte 5. While the migration has been rigorously tested, there is a possibility that some features may not function as expected. We encourage you to report any issues you encounter.

Additionally, the location search functionality has been transitioned from a locally hosted meilisearch index to nominatim. This upgrade offers substantially improved location search capabilities within wanderer. As a result, the custom meilisearch docker image (`flomp/wanderer-search`) is now deprecated. You can safely replace it with the official meilisearch image (`getmeili/meilisearch:v1.11.3`) in your `docker-compose.yml`.
:::

:::caution
This release contains breaking changes. Most migrations will happen automatically, but you will need to take action in two places that will be clearly marked ⚠️ further down.
:::
### Maintenance
- Updates to meilisearch version 0.11.3. 
- ⚠️ meilisearch indices are not compatible across minor versions. This means you will need to rename or delete your [`data.ms`](https://github.com/Flomp/wanderer/blob/8635de78b9f1510e2316b08e605b175a2615f4db/docker-compose.yml#L19) folder on your host system to force meilisearch to rebuild the index on the next start (note that this can take a little while). 

### Features
- Adds password reset email function for users (see [docs](https://wanderer.to/guides/authentication/#forgot-your-password) for more info)
- You can now add photos to your summit logs
- Complete rewrite of the map logic switching from raster to vector tiles

⚠️ Custom raster tilesets added via `Settings -> Display -> Tilesets` will no longer work. You will have to delete them for the map to show correctly. Tileset URLs must now point to a valid `style.json` describing a vector tileset (see [docs](https://wanderer.to/guides/customize-map/#custom-map-styles) for more info).
- 3D Terrain and Hillshading are now available (see [docs](https://wanderer.to/guides/customize-map/#terrain--hillshading) fore more info)
- Adds two more default map styles: CARTO Light & Dark
- Adds loading animations for trail lists

### Bug fixes

- Fixes bug that caused a new trail to be created instead of updated when uploading a new GPS data source to an existing trail
- Fixes bug that caused trails to throw a 404 error when they had summit logs created before v0.11.0
- Waypoint markers can now also be dragged after a trail was saved
- Fixes issue with GPX export when using Google Chrome (thanks [@tofublock](https://github.com/tofublock))
