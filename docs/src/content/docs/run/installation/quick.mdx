description: The fastest way to try wanderer. Runs everything with Docker in just two commands.
---

You can install <span class="-tracking-[0.075em]">wanderer</span> components either via Docker ([Quick Setup](./quick) or [Advanced Setup](./docker)) or [from source](./installation-from-source).

For a quick setup, you can run the following command in your terminal.
This will load a `docker-compose.yml` and start the services.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flomp/wanderer/refs/heads/main/setup.sh)"
docker compose up -d
```

After a few seconds, you should be able to access <span class="-tracking-[0.075em]">wanderer</span> at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Updating

To update your instance to the latest version:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Always consult the [changelog](/changelog) before updating, in case of breaking changes.
