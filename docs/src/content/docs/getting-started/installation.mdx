import { version } from '../../../../package.json';

wanderer consists of three components: 
1. the frontend written with [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit)
2. the backend, a custom [PocketBase](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase) fork
3. the index, a standard [meilisearch](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch) application

You can install these components in two ways.

## Docker

This is the easiest and most convenient way to install wanderer. After cloning the repository you will find a [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/Flomp/wanderer/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file in the root directory that will install and run all necessary components by running `docker compose up -d`.

:::note
If you are not hosting wanderer at `http://localhost:3000` make sure to change `ORIGIN` environment variable to `http(s)://<your_domain>:<your_port>`. Otherwise you will run into CORS errors.

### Networking
All three components must be on the same network for wanderer to function properly. This is the case in the default configuration shown above. However, if you run wanderer behind a proxy like traefik, please ensure all three components can communicate.
Notice that you must set the `ORIGIN` environment variable for the web service to the public IP or hostname including the port that wanderer is reachable at. Otherwise, you will see wanderer's frontend throw an `Cross-site POST form submissions are forbidden` error.

The standard configuration makes all three services publically available by forwarding their ports. For the database and the index service this is not strictly necessary. In case you do not require direct access to them you can disable their ports in the docker-compose file.

### Volumes
By default, wanderer uses two volumes. One for meilisearch indices and one for all PocketBase data. In the default configuration, the data is stored in volumes. However, if you prefer to use bind mounts you can simply adapt the configuration accordingly.

### Environment
The default configuration contains all necessary environment variables. However, there are more options that allow you to modify how the backend and index operate. For more details, you can take a look at the respective section of the [documentation](/getting-started/configuration).

:::caution
Ensure that you change the `MEILI_MASTER_KEY` to a different value if you plan to use wanderer in a production environment.

### Updating

To update all containers to a new version simply run `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`. Make sure to read the changelog to check for breaking changes.

## From source

While not recommended it is absolutely possible to install wanderer from source. 

### Prerequisites
1. git installed && git clone https://github.com/Flomp/wanderer.git --branch v{version} --single-branch
2. go >= 1.23.0 installed
3. node >= 18.17.0 installed
4. npm >= 8.15.0 installed

### meilisearch
wanderer uses meilisearch without any further modifications. As a result, you can simply head over to [their website](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/getting_started/installation) and follow the instructions for your preferred platform. We assume that you put the binary in the `wanderer/search` directory. If you did not, adapt the launch script below accordingly.

### PocketBase
wanderer uses a slightly modified version of the PocketBase backend framework. As a result, you will need to build the PocketBase binary first.
```bash
cd wanderer/db
go mod tidy && go build
```
This will create a binary in the `wanderer/db` folder. Verify that it is there.

### Web
wanderer's frontend is written in SvelteKit. We first install all dependencies and build the project.
```bash
cd wanderer/web
npm ci --omit=dev
npm run build
```

This will create a directory `wanderer/web/build`. Verify that it is there.

In case vitest is not installed please do so using
```bash
npm i -s vitest
```

### Launch

To launch our three services we will use a small bash script. This ensures that all necessary environment variables are set and the services are started in the correct order. All three services are executed as background tasks, but are being trapped so that terminating the bash script will also terminate all three services at once.

:::caution
Caution: Ensure that you change the `MEILI_MASTER_KEY` to a different value if you plan to use wanderer in a production environment.

### Updating

To update wanderer to the newest version simply run `git pull origin main` and run the launch script. Make sure to read the changelog to check for breaking changes.

## Verify the installation
No matter which installation method you chose, you should now be able to access wanderer on localhost:3000.
