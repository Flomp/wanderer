Summit logs are a way to document and share each of your trail completions, whether you're repeating a route or contributing your experience to a trail uploaded by someone else.

## What is a Summit Log?

A summit log is an entry attached to a trail that records an individual outing. It can be created by the author of the trail or by any other user, as long as the trail is public. Summit logs allow for a more detailed and personal view of how and when a trail was completed, including photos, GPS data, and written reflections.

## When to Use a Summit Log

If you are hiking a trail that already exists on <span class="-tracking-[0.075em]">wanderer</span> — whether uploaded by you or another user — you can log your hike by creating a summit log instead of uploading the trail again. This helps avoid duplicates and keeps the trail history consolidated. Summit logs are perfect for re-hikes, community contributions, or simply marking your progress over time.

## What You Can Include

When creating a summit log, you can provide the following:

- **Date** of the outing
- **Photos and videos** specific to this hike
- **A separate GPS track** (if different from the original)
- **Text description** with formatting options

Mentions of other users can be included directly in the description field using the `@user@domain` format. Mentioned users will receive a notification and can view the summit log where they were referenced.

## Creating a Summit Log

To create a summit log, go to the trail's page and select the **"Add Entry"** button in the **Summit Book** tab. A form will appear where you can input your outing's details. If you are the author of the trail or have permission to edit the trail, you can also add a new summit log by editing an existing trail. Once saved, your entry will appear in the Summit Book table on the trail page.

## Visibility and Interaction

Summit logs are visible to other users but cannot receive comments or likes. Interaction is limited to the original trail, where others can leave feedback and appreciation.

For more on mentions and notifications, refer to the [community interaction](/use/community-interaction) section of the documentation.
