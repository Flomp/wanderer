Lists allow you to further organise your trails by bundling them in one place. Over at `/lists` you can create, update, share and delete your custom lists.

## Create a list

Simply click the <button class="h-10 text-white rounded-lg px-4 py-2 mx-2 bg-primary font-semibold transition-all hover:bg-primary-hover focus:ring-4 ring-zinc-400 leading-none">+ New List</button> button. You will be redirected to the editor where you can give your list a name and add one or more trails to it. Optionally, you can also add an avatar and a short description. 

To add a trail to the list simply search for it and click on the search suggestion. After adding a trail you can change its position in the list using the up- and down arrows. 

Once you are done creating your list simply click the <button class="h-10 text-white rounded-lg px-4 py-2 mx-2 bg-primary font-semibold transition-all hover:bg-primary-hover focus:ring-4 ring-zinc-400 leading-none">Save List</button> button at the bottom.

## Share a list
You can also share a list to allow other users access it. To do so select the list in the overview and click "Share" in the ⋮ menu. Everything else works analogous to <a href="/guides/share-trails#share-a-trail">sharing a trail</a>. Depending on the permission you set for the shared list a user can simply view the list or also modify its contents.

:::caution
Sharing a list with another user will also automatically share all trails contained in that list with the user. Unsharing a list will _not_ automatically unshare all trails contained in the list.

## Edit & delete a list

To edit or delete a list first select it from the overview. Then you can select the respective entry from the ⋮ menu.
