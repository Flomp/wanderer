description: Build, install, and run WASM provider plugins in wanderer
---

Plugins let wanderer connect to external providers such as Strava, komoot, and
Hammerhead without adding provider-specific API code to the core application.

A plugin is a local directory with a `plugin.json` manifest and a WASM
entrypoint:

```text
data/plugins/
  strava/
    plugin.json
    plugin.wasm
    icon.svg
```
wanderer discovers plugins from direct child directories of `data/plugins`.
Plugin configuration, credentials, sync state, and status are stored per user in
`plugin_instances`.

## Quickstart

Use an existing first-party plugin as a starting point:

- [Hammerhead plugin source](https://github.com/open-wanderer/wanderer/tree/main/plugins/hammerhead)
- [Immich plugin source](https://github.com/open-wanderer/wanderer/tree/main/plugins/immich)
- [komoot plugin source](https://github.com/open-wanderer/wanderer/tree/main/plugins/komoot)
- [Strava plugin source](https://github.com/open-wanderer/wanderer/tree/main/plugins/strava)

For local development:

```sh
make plugins-build
make plugins-install-local
```

Start wanderer and open the plugin settings page. The plugin should appear once
its bundle exists at:

```text
data/plugins/<plugin-id>/plugin.json
data/plugins/<plugin-id>/plugin.wasm
```

## 1st-party plugins

First-party plugin source lives in the repository under `plugins/`:

```text
plugins/
  hammerhead/
  immich/
  komoot/
  strava/
  sdk/
```

Build all bundled plugins:

```sh
make plugins-build
```

Build and install them into the local runtime directory:

```sh
make plugins-install-local
```

Package release archives:

```sh
make plugins-package
```

Release archives are published as separate GitHub release assets. The database
Docker image does not contain provider plugins.

## Plugin layout

A provider plugin should use this layout:

```text
plugins/<provider>/
  go.mod
  plugin.json
  main.go
  assets/icon.svg
  Makefile
```

Generated runtime files are written to `dist/<plugin-id>/` and are ignored by
git:

```text
plugins/strava/dist/strava/
  plugin.json
  plugin.wasm
  icon.svg
```

The generated `dist/<plugin-id>` directory is the directory users install below
`data/plugins`.

Icons are referenced from `plugin.json` metadata and copied from `assets/` into
the dist directory by the plugin `Makefile`:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "icons": {
      "light": "icon.svg",
      "dark": "icon_dark.svg"
    }
  }
}
```

`dark` is optional.

## Go SDK

Go/TinyGo plugins should import the plugin SDK:

```go
import "github.com/open-wanderer/wanderer/plugins/sdk"
```

The SDK contains plugin-side protocol types and host-function helpers. It does
not depend on wanderer core or PocketBase.

Most plugins use:

- `sdk.HostRequest` for provider API calls through `wanderer.http_request`
- `sdk.Get` and `sdk.PostJSON` convenience helpers
- `sdk.HostRequestSpec`, `sdk.ResponseExpect`, and multipart body constants
- auth/header constants such as `sdk.AuthHeaderAuthorization`

## Manifest

Each plugin must define a static `plugin.json` manifest. The manifest is the
security and capability contract used by the host.

The repository includes a JSON Schema at
`plugins/schema/plugin.schema.json`. Add a `$schema` field in source manifests
to get editor completion and inline validation:

```json
{
  "$schema": "../schema/plugin.schema.json"
}
```

Minimal shape:

```json
{
  "manifestVersion": "1.0",
  "id": "example",
  "type": "trails",
  "name": "Example",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "runtime": {
    "type": "wasm",
    "entrypoint": "plugin.wasm"
  },
  "capabilities": [
    {
      "name": "list_routes",
      "version": "v1",
      "export": "list_routes_v1"
    },
    {
      "name": "get_route_detail",
      "version": "v1",
      "export": "get_route_detail_v1"
    }
  ],
  "permissions": {
    "network": {
      "connectors": [
        {
          "name": "api",
          "type": "public_api",
          "fixedBaseURL": "https://api.example.com",
          "allowedPathPrefixes": ["/v1"]
        }
      ]
    },
    "downloads": {
      "maxBytes": 1048576,
      "contentTypes": ["application/json"]
    }
  }
}
```

Important rules:

- `type` is the functional plugin category. Currently `trails` and `assets` are supported.
- `runtime.entrypoint` must be relative to the plugin directory.
- `id` must match the installed directory name by convention.
- `capabilities[].export` names the WASM export the runtime calls.
- `permissions.network.connectors` declares every provider target the plugin may
  request through the host.
- per-request limits may narrow manifest limits, but never expand them.
- `configSchema[].required` marks plugin-owned settings that the settings UI
  must collect before saving.

### Network connectors

Provider HTTP is connector-based. Plugins do not send absolute provider URLs to
the host; they name a connector and a relative path. The host resolves that
connector to a concrete base URL, validates the path scope, injects auth, and
executes the request.

Connector types:

| Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `public_api` | Fixed public provider API declared in the manifest. Use this for SaaS APIs such as Strava, komoot, or Hammerhead. |
| `configured` | Provider target configured by the host under `config.host.connectors`. Use this for self-hosted services. |

`public_api` connectors must declare `fixedBaseURL`:

```json
{
  "name": "api",
  "type": "public_api",
  "fixedBaseURL": "https://api.example.com",
  "allowedPathPrefixes": ["/v1"],
  "auth": ["oauth_access_token"]
}
```

`configured` connectors must declare `configKey`; the host supplies the concrete
base URL and trust settings:

Asset plugins may derive a connector base URL from a user-owned plugin URL when
the administrator leaves the connector `baseURL` empty. Such derived targets
are always public-network only and do not inherit custom TLS trust or storage
redirect origins. Private-network access, custom CAs, and storage redirects
therefore require a fixed administrator-configured connector `baseURL`.

```json
{
  "name": "media",
  "type": "configured",
  "configKey": "immich",
  "allowedPathPrefixes": ["/api"],
  "auth": ["api_key"],
  "supportsMediaAuth": true,
  "supportsStorageRedirects": true,
  "supportsCustomTLS": true
}
```

Connector fields:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Connector identifier used by `HostRequestSpec.target.connector` and `MediaRef.connector`. |
| `type` | `public_api` or `configured`. |
| `fixedBaseURL` | Fixed URL for public APIs. Must not include credentials, query, or fragment. |
| `configKey` | Host config key for configured connectors. |
| `allowedPathPrefixes` | Relative provider paths the plugin may request. Defaults to `/` when empty. |
| `auth` | Auth contexts allowed for this connector. |
| `supportsMediaAuth` | Allows connector media downloads to reference an auth context. |
| `supportsStorageRedirects` | Allows connector media downloads to redirect to configured storage origins. |
| `supportsCustomTLS` | Allows the host to attach a custom CA bundle to this connector. |

The host validates scheme, host, effective port, base path, path prefixes,
redirect targets, TLS policy, and IP policy. `allowPrivate`, custom CA bundles,
and storage origins are host-owned settings; plugin output can never enable
private-network access. When a configured connector has no administrative
`baseURL` and the target is therefore derived from the user-editable
`plugin.url`, `allowPrivate`, custom TLS, and storage origins fall back to their
defaults: trust granted for a fixed administrative origin is never inherited by
a target a normal user picked.

## Capabilities

Implemented sync/send capabilities:

| Capability | Export Example | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `list_routes.v1` | `list_routes_v1` | List planned route IDs |
| `get_route_detail.v1` | `get_route_detail_v1` | Return one planned route import |
| `list_activities.v1` | `list_activities_v1` | List completed activity IDs |
| `get_activity_detail.v1` | `get_activity_detail_v1` | Return one completed activity import |
| `prepare_trail_send.v1` | `prepare_trail_send_v1` | Prepare sending a trail |
| `asset_library.v1` | `asset_library_v1` | Find and import external media assets |

Import sync is a two-step protocol. A plugin that declares `list_routes.v1`
must also declare `get_route_detail.v1`; a plugin that declares
`list_activities.v1` must also declare `get_activity_detail.v1`. If the matching
detail capability is missing, the host skips that list capability and logs a
warning. This is a breaking change from older one-step sync plugins whose
`list_*` exports returned full trail imports.

Session-based plugins may also export an auth refresh function declared by the
manifest, for example:

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "contexts": {
      "provider_session": {
        "type": "session",
        "fields": ["email", "password"],
        "secretFields": ["password"],
        "refresh": {
          "mode": "plugin",
          "function": "refresh_session_v1"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Sync input

`list_routes_v1` and `list_activities_v1` receive JSON input:

```json
{
  "instance": {
    "id": "abc123",
    "pluginId": "strava"
  },
  "auth": {},
  "state": {},
  "options": {
    "after": "2026-01-01"
  },
  "limits": {
    "maxItems": 50
  }
}
```

`auth` contains only values the host is allowed to pass to the plugin. For
OAuth plugins, refresh tokens and client secrets are not included in normal sync
capability input. Depending on the auth model, `auth` may contain values such
as:

```json
{
  "accessToken": "short-lived-token"
}
```

or, for session-based providers:

```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "encrypted-at-rest-but-decrypted-for-plugin-login"
}
```

## List output

List capabilities return lightweight summaries plus capability-local state. The
host uses `source.provider` and `source.externalId` for deduplication and calls
the matching detail capability only for new items.

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "source": {
        "provider": "strava",
        "externalId": "123",
        "url": "https://provider.example/routes/123"
      },
      "kind": "planned"
    }
  ],
  "state": {
    "page": 2
  },
  "hasMore": true
}
```

State returned by a plugin is first fed back into the next batch of the same
sync run. Only persistent provider cursors belong in `plugin_instances.state`.
Transient batch cursors such as `page` are not stored in the database.

## Detail input

`get_route_detail_v1` and `get_activity_detail_v1` receive the summary selected
by the host:

```json
{
  "instance": {
    "id": "abc123",
    "pluginId": "strava"
  },
  "auth": {},
  "options": {
    "after": "2026-01-01"
  },
  "summary": {
    "source": {
      "provider": "strava",
      "externalId": "123"
    },
    "kind": "planned"
  }
}
```

## Detail output

Detail capabilities return the full trail import:

```json
{
  "item": {
    "source": {
      "provider": "strava",
      "externalId": "123",
      "url": "https://provider.example/routes/123"
    },
    "kind": "planned",
      "name": "Morning Ride",
      "track": {
        "format": "gpx",
        "contentBase64": "..."
      },
      "waypoints": [
        {
          "name": "Viewpoint",
          "lat": 47.3769,
          "lon": 8.5417,
          "photos": [
            {
              "filename": "viewpoint.jpg",
              "contentType": "image/jpeg",
              "source": {
                "type": "url",
                "url": "https://provider.example/photo.jpg"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "metadata": {
        "distance": 12345.6,
        "elevationGain": 320.5,
        "elevationLoss": 318.1,
        "duration": 4567,
        "providerCategory": "Ride"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The host imports the trails, writes PocketBase records, applies visibility
rules, deduplicates by provider/external ID, and stores the returned state.
Trail photos are attached to the imported trail. Waypoint photos are attached to
the corresponding waypoint records. Waypoint `distance_from_start` is derived
by the host from the nearest position on the imported GPX track.

Media sources have two trust models:

| Source type | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `url` | Public external media URL. The host fetches it with public-only SSRF protections and bounded size limits. |
| `connector` | Provider-owned media fetched through a declared connector, optional host-injected auth, connector TLS/IP policy, and connector-scoped redirects. |

Public media example:

```json
{
  "filename": "cover.jpg",
  "contentType": "image/jpeg",
  "source": {
    "type": "url",
    "url": "https://cdn.example.com/photos/cover.jpg"
  }
}
```

Connector media example:

```json
{
  "filename": "original.jpg",
  "contentType": "image/jpeg",
  "source": {
    "type": "connector",
    "mediaRef": {
      "connector": "media",
      "auth": "api_key",
      "path": "/api/assets/123/original",
      "query": [
        { "name": "size", "value": "preview" }
      ],
      "assetId": "123"
    }
  }
}
```

`mediaRef.path` is required for connector downloads. `assetId` is metadata only
for now; the host does not resolve `assetId` into a URL.

Plugins should return GPX as the canonical track. If the provider exposes
authoritative summary metrics, the plugin may additionally return them in
`metadata`:

| Metadata key | Unit | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `distance` | meters | Provider-reported trail distance. |
| `elevationGain` | meters | Provider-reported positive elevation gain. |
| `elevationLoss` | meters | Provider-reported negative elevation loss. |
| `duration` | seconds | Provider-reported elapsed duration. |
| `providerStart` | object | Provider-reported intended start coordinate, for example `{ "lat": 47.123, "lon": 8.456 }`. |
| `providerCategory` | string | Raw provider activity/category value used by host category mapping. |

The host uses positive provider metrics when present and falls back to GPX
derived metrics otherwise. Start location comes from the GPX unless
`providerStart` is present and close enough to the imported GPX track to be
plausible. Plugins should not map `providerCategory` to local category IDs; the
host owns that mapping.

## Asset library capability

Asset plugins declare `type: "assets"` and expose `asset_library.v1`. The host
calls the same export with different `request.action` values:

| Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `check` | Validate current auth/config and optionally return provider account metadata. |
| `candidates` | Return matching external assets for a trail, coordinate, or waypoint context. |
| `import` | Return `Photo` descriptors for selected asset IDs so the host can create asset records. |
| `thumbnail` | Return a preview photo descriptor for one selected asset ID. |

Input shape:

```json
{
  "instance": {
    "id": "abc123",
    "pluginId": "immich"
  },
  "auth": {
    "apiKey": "..."
  },
  "config": {
    "url": "https://photos.example.com",
    "timeWindowMinutes": 30
  },
  "request": {
    "action": "candidates",
    "trailId": "trail123",
    "lat": 47.3769,
    "lon": 8.5417,
    "points": [
      {
        "lat": 47.3769,
        "lon": 8.5417,
        "distance": 1200,
        "timestamp": "2026-06-23T10:15:00Z"
      }
    ],
    "startedAt": "2026-06-23T10:00:00Z",
    "endedAt": "2026-06-23T12:00:00Z",
    "takenAfter": "2026-06-23T09:30:00Z",
    "takenBefore": "2026-06-23T12:30:00Z",
    "doubleRadius": false,
    "assetIds": ["provider-asset-id"]
  }
}
```

The host supplies the fields that are relevant for the current action. For
trail-based searches, `points` contains track points with cumulative
`distance`; timestamps are present only when the imported or uploaded trail has
time data. `takenAfter` and `takenBefore` are explicit search-window hints when
the host or user provides them. For waypoint searches, the host may only provide
`lat` and `lon`.

Runtime failures are reported by the failed export call, application failures
must use the structured `error` field, and HTTP clients use the response status.

Candidate output:

```json
{
  "candidates": [
    {
      "assetId": "provider-asset-id",
      "originalFileName": "IMG_1234.jpg",
      "takenAt": "2026-06-23T10:18:00Z",
      "lat": 47.377,
      "lon": 8.542,
      "distance": 32.4,
      "pointLat": 47.3769,
      "pointLon": 8.5417,
      "distanceFromStart": 1200,
      "city": "Zurich",
      "country": "Switzerland"
    }
  ],
  "hasMore": false,
  "takenAfter": "2026-06-23T09:30:00Z",
  "hasTimestamps": true
}
```

`import` and `thumbnail` actions return `photos`. Each photo uses the same
`Photo` and `MediaSource` shape as trail imports:

```json
{
  "photos": [
    {
      "externalId": "provider-asset-id",
      "filename": "IMG_1234.jpg",
      "contentType": "image/jpeg",
      "takenAt": "2026-06-23T10:18:00Z",
      "lat": 47.377,
      "lon": 8.542,
      "source": {
        "type": "connector",
        "mediaRef": {
          "connector": "api",
          "auth": "api_key",
          "path": "/api/assets/provider-asset-id/original",
          "assetId": "provider-asset-id"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The host owns storage behavior. In `copy` mode it downloads selected photos and
stores PocketBase files. In `link_private` mode it stores remote metadata and
fetches files on demand for non-public targets, copying them into wanderer when
the trail becomes public or when a user materializes linked photos. Public trail
targets are always copied because private provider media cannot be served to
anonymous viewers. Plugins should return stable `externalId` values so the host
can deduplicate provider assets.

When imported asset photos create new waypoints, the host merges nearby photos
using the trail category's waypoint merge settings. It resolves waypoint names
from nearby OpenStreetMap points of interest through Overpass and falls back to
Nominatim reverse geocoding, then to the photo coordinate.

## Host config

Plugin manifests may suggest defaults for host-owned settings with
`hostConfig`. These values are stored in `installed_plugins.config.host` and can
be overridden per plugin instance with `plugin_instances.config.host` only for
the explicitly supported user-level fields listed below. Connector targets and
trust settings under `host.connectors` remain exclusively in the
administrator-controlled `installed_plugins.config.host` and are ignored if
submitted through a plugin instance. Host config is never passed to plugin
exports.

Supported host fields:

| Field | Type | Used by | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `planned` | boolean | `list_routes.v1` | Enables planned route sync for the instance. |
| `completed` | boolean | `list_activities.v1` | Enables completed activity sync for the instance. |
| `privacy` | string | Trail import | `original` keeps provider visibility; `settings` uses the local user trail privacy setting. |
| `merge.available` | boolean | Trail import | Controls whether the settings UI offers auto-merge for this plugin. Defaults to `true`. |
| `merge.enabled` | boolean | Trail import | Runs auto-merge after creating imported trails. |
| `createSummitLogForCompleted` | boolean | Trail import | Creates summit logs for completed imported trails. Defaults to `true`. |
| `categoryMapping` | object | Trail import | Maps plugin-provided `metadata.providerCategory` values to local category or subcategory targets. |
| `connectors` | object | Host request/media policy | Administrator-owned concrete settings for configured connectors; never overridable per plugin instance. |
| `photoMode` | string | Asset import | `copy` or `link_private`. Defaults to `copy`. |
| `maxPhotosPerTrail` | integer | Asset import | Maximum number of asset plugin photos imported for one trail during enforced automatic attachment flows. Defaults to `20`. |
| `maxPhotosPerWaypoint` | integer | Asset import | Maximum number of asset plugin photos imported for one waypoint during enforced automatic attachment flows. Defaults to `5`. |
| `maxPhotosPerSummitLog` | integer | Asset import | Maximum number of asset plugin photos imported for one summit log during enforced automatic attachment flows. Defaults to `20`. |
| `autoAttach.trailPlugins` | boolean | Asset import | Automatically attach matching asset photos after completed trail plugin imports with track timestamps. Defaults to `true`. |
| `autoAttach.upload` | boolean | Asset import | Automatically attach matching asset photos after GPX uploads with track timestamps. Defaults to `true`. |

The settings UI lets users edit `categoryMapping` per plugin instance for trail
import plugins. A mapping value can be a string for broad category-only
compatibility, or an object with `category` and optional `subcategory`. Category
and subcategory values may be local record IDs or canonical names. Unknown or
empty provider categories still fall back to the host's activity-type mapping.

Example:

```json
{
  "hostConfig": {
    "categoryMapping": {
      "Ride": {
        "category": "Biking",
        "subcategory": "Road"
      },
      "GravelRide": {
        "category": "Biking",
        "subcategory": "Gravel"
      },
      "Hike": "Hiking"
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "providerCategories": {
      "Ride": {
        "labels": {
          "de": "Radfahren",
          "en": "Ride"
        }
      },
      "Hike": {
        "labels": {
          "de": "Wandern",
          "en": "Hike"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`metadata.providerCategories` is display-only metadata for provider-owned
category values. The `categoryMapping` keys still use the raw values emitted as
`metadata.providerCategory`.

Configured connector host config shape:

```json
{
  "hostConfig": {
    "connectors": {
      "immich": {
        "baseURL": "https://photos.example.com",
        "basePath": "/immich",
        "allowPrivate": false,
        "tls": {
          "mode": "system"
        },
        "storageOrigins": {
          "object-storage": {
            "baseURL": "https://storage.example.com",
            "basePath": "/assets",
            "allowPrivate": false,
            "tls": {
              "mode": "system"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`tls.mode` supports `system` and `customCA`. Custom CA bundles are trusted only
when the manifest connector declares `supportsCustomTLS`; certificate
verification is not disabled.

Leaving `baseURL` empty makes the connector target follow the user-editable
`plugin.url` of each plugin instance. In that case `allowPrivate`, `tls`, and
`storageOrigins` configured here do not apply, so combining an empty `baseURL`
with `allowPrivate: true` does not grant users private-network access. Set a
concrete `baseURL` for connectors that must reach a private or otherwise
specially trusted origin.

The host defines the semantics of these fields. Plugins only provide defaults
or hints; custom plugin settings belong in `configSchema` and are passed to the
plugin under `options` for sync capabilities and under `config` for asset and
trail-send capabilities.

Plugin errors should use the structured error format:

## Host requests

Plugins cannot perform arbitrary provider I/O. They ask the host to execute
provider requests through the WASM host function `wanderer.http_request`.
Absolute provider URLs are not part of the request ABI.

The request shape is `HostRequestSpec`:

```json
{
  "method": "GET",
  "target": {
    "type": "connector",
    "connector": "api",
    "path": "/routes",
    "query": [
      { "name": "page", "value": "1" }
    ]
  },
  "auth": "oauth_access_token",
  "headers": {
    "accept": "application/json"
  },
  "expect": {
    "contentTypes": ["application/json"],
    "maxBytes": 1048576
  }
}
```

The host validates:

- connector identity, scheme, host, effective port, base path, and path scope
- auth context reference and connector-specific auth allowance
- manifest network permissions
- response content type
- response size
- redirect target scope

The shared Go SDK wraps this host function:

```go
response, body, err := sdk.HostRequest(sdk.HostRequestSpec{
    Method: "GET",
    Target: sdk.RequestTarget{
        Type:      "connector",
        Connector: "api",
        Path:      "/routes",
        Query:     []sdk.QueryParam{{Name: "page", Value: "1"}},
    },
    Expect: sdk.ResponseExpect{
        ContentTypes: []string{"application/json"},
        MaxBytes:     1048576,
    },
})
```

Auth referenced by `HostRequestSpec.auth` is injected by the host. OAuth,
bearer, and API-key contexts are supported for plugin-initiated host requests.
Session auth requires handler-managed injection; if a plugin calls
`wanderer.http_request` with a session auth context, the host rejects the
request instead of silently sending it unauthenticated.

## Sending trails

`prepare_trail_send_v1` receives the trail GPX from wanderer and returns a
send plan. The plugin prepares the provider-specific request; the host
executes it.

Input:

```json
{
  "instance": {
    "id": "abc123",
    "pluginId": "hammerhead"
  },
  "auth": {},
  "config": {},
  "name": "Lunch Loop",
  "trail": {
    "format": "gpx",
    "contentBase64": "..."
  }
}
```

`config` contains the saved plugin instance configuration, for example sync
modes, an `after` date, or provider-specific options. `auth` follows the same
rules as sync input.

Output:

```json
{
  "request": {
    "method": "POST",
    "target": {
      "type": "connector",
      "connector": "api",
      "path": "/routes"
    },
    "auth": "provider_session",
    "body": {
      "type": "multipart",
      "parts": [
        {
          "name": "file",
          "source": "trail"
        }
      ]
    },
    "expect": {
      "contentTypes": ["application/json"],
      "maxBytes": 1048576
    }
  }
}
```

Supported multipart trail sources:

```text
trail
trail.gpx
```

## Auth

Auth contexts are declared in the manifest and referenced by name from
`HostRequestSpec.auth`.

### OAuth2

OAuth is declarative. The host runs authorization, token exchange, token
storage, and refresh:

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "contexts": {
      "oauth_access_token": {
        "type": "oauth2",
        "fields": ["clientId", "clientSecret"],
        "secretFields": ["clientSecret", "accessToken", "refreshToken"],
        "authorizationUrl": "https://provider.example/oauth/authorize",
        "tokenUrl": "https://provider.example/oauth/token",
        "scopes": ["activity:read_all"],
        "scopeSeparator": ",",
        "tokenRequestFormat": "json",
        "tokenAuth": "client_secret_post",
        "refresh": {
          "mode": "host",
          "grantType": "refresh_token"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The plugin may receive the short-lived access token in normal capability input.
It does not receive refresh tokens or client secrets during normal sync.
OAuth token endpoints must be covered by a fixed `public_api` connector in the
manifest. Token exchange does not use user-configured connector origins.

### Session

Session auth is for providers that require plugin-mediated login:

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "contexts": {
      "provider_session": {
        "type": "session",
        "fields": ["email", "password"],
        "secretFields": ["password"],
        "refresh": {
          "mode": "plugin",
          "function": "refresh_session_v1"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The host passes only the declared secret fields to the refresh export. The
returned session token is stored encrypted and injected by the host into future
handler-managed host-executed requests that reference the auth context, such as
`prepare_trail_send.v1` send plans. Plugin-initiated `wanderer.http_request`
calls cannot refresh session auth themselves.

### API key and bearer

API key and bearer contexts use a configured secret field:

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "contexts": {
      "api_key": {
        "type": "api_key",
        "placement": "header",
        "name": "x-api-key",
        "secretField": "apiKey"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Runtime isolation

WASM plugins run in a separate worker process for each sync or trail-upload job.
All exports within that job share the same worker session and are called
sequentially. If a plugin calls `wanderer.http_request`, the worker forwards the
request bytes back to the backend; the backend remains the only process that
holds connector policy, decrypted host auth, custom CA bundles, and HTTP
execution logic.

The worker boundary protects the backend from plugin crashes and hangs and
enforces request/response frame limits and timeouts. It is not an OS-level
sandbox for outbound network access; plugin-controlled provider traffic must
still go through the host request API.

## Plugin state

User plugin configuration is stored in `plugin_instances`:

```text
plugin_instances
  user
  plugin_id
  enabled
  auth
  config
  state
  status
  last_error
  last_sync_at
  retry_not_before
```

`auth` is encrypted by PocketBase hooks. `config.plugin` stores settings passed
to the plugin, such as an `after` date. `config.host` stores host-owned settings
such as enabled capabilities, privacy handling, merge settings, and category
mapping. `state` stores per-capability provider cursors. It should only contain
values that remain valid across separate sync runs, such as provider sync tokens
or delta cursors. Batch-local cursors such as `page` are discarded before the
instance is saved.

The host also caches discovered plugin manifests in `installed_plugins`.
Installed plugins and user plugin instances are intentionally separate:
`installed_plugins.config` stores admin defaults, while
`plugin_instances.config` stores per-instance overrides. A user configuration
can exist even if the plugin bundle is not currently installed.

## Release and installation

The release workflow builds plugin archives:

```text
wanderer-plugin-hammerhead.tar.gz
wanderer-plugin-immich.tar.gz
wanderer-plugin-komoot.tar.gz
wanderer-plugin-strava.tar.gz
SHA256SUMS
```

Users install a plugin by extracting the archive below `data/plugins`:

```text
data/plugins/hammerhead/plugin.json
data/plugins/hammerhead/plugin.wasm
```

Docker deployments mount the runtime directory into the DB container:

```yaml
services:
  db:
    volumes:
      - ./data/plugins:/data/plugins
```
