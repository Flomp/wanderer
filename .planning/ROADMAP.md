<details>
<summary>✅ v1.3 Category Redesign (Phases 10-12) — SHIPPED 2026-07-02</summary>

**Milestone Goal:** Bring the Flutter app's category system to parity with web PR #1059 — a translations/icon/short_name-aware Category model, a new Subcategory model + provider, subcategory-aware trail filters, and a Settings → Categories screen for per-category/subcategory visibility and priority preferences.

- [x] **Phase 10: Category & Subcategory Data Layer** (4/4 plans) — completed 2026-06-29
- [x] **Phase 11: Trail Filter Subcategory Support** (4/4 plans) — completed 2026-07-02
- [x] **Phase 12: Settings Categories Screen** (4/4 plans) — completed 2026-07-02

### Phase 10: Category & Subcategory Data Layer

**Goal**: The app's category data model matches web PR #1059 — categories expose locale-aware names, subcategories are fetched and cached, preference models and providers are in place, and the deprecated favourite-sport field is gone.
**Depends on**: Phase 9 (v1.2 settings infrastructure)
**Requirements**: CAT-01, CAT-02, CAT-03, CAT-04, CAT-05, SETCAT-03, SETCAT-04, SETCAT-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. A category's display name renders in the active locale, falling back to English then the raw `name`, and exposes its `icon` and `short_name`.
  2. Subcategories load from `/subcategory` through a Riverpod provider and persist to ObjectBox with indexed `id` and `category` fields, surviving app restarts.
  3. Each subcategory carries its parent `category` id, `name`, `short_name`, `icon`, `badge_icon`, and `translations`.
  4. CategoryPreferenceNotifier and SubcategoryPreferenceNotifier providers fetch the user's preferences from their respective API endpoints.
  5. The app builds and runs with `Settings.category` removed — no remaining references to the old favourite-sport field.

**Plans**: 4 plans

  - [x] 10-01-PLAN.md — Category + Subcategory + CategoryTranslation models, locale displayName (CAT-01, CAT-02)
  - [x] 10-02-PLAN.md — CategoryEntity extension + SubcategoryEntity (indexed id/category, JSON-blob translations) (CAT-03)
  - [x] 10-03-PLAN.md — Preference models + CategoryPreferenceNotifier/SubcategoryPreferenceNotifier providers (SETCAT-03/04/05)
  - [x] 10-04-PLAN.md — CategoryNotifier ObjectBox write, cache-first SubcategoryNotifier, remove Settings.category (CAT-04, CAT-05)

### Phase 11: Trail Filter Subcategory Support

**Goal**: Users can narrow trail searches by subcategory in both the full filter screen and the quick filter bar, with category labels shown in their language and hidden categories/subcategories omitted from the picker.
**Depends on**: Phase 10
**Requirements**: FILTER-01, FILTER-02, FILTER-03, FILTER-04, FILTER-05, FILTER-06, FILTER-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. With at least one category selected in TrailFilterScreen, the user sees subcategory chips limited to the subcategories of those selected categories.
  2. Tapping subcategory chips toggles them and changes which trails the search returns (the subcategory selection reaches the API filter payload).
  3. Category chips throughout the filter UI display locale-resolved names using the CAT-01 fallback chain.
  4. The quick filter bar's Category bottom sheet lets the user pick both categories and subcategories, and the chosen filter persists in the active trail filter.
  5. Categories and subcategories the user has marked hidden in Settings → Categories do not appear as selectable chips in the filter UI.

**Plans**: 4 plans
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 12: Settings Categories Screen

**Goal**: A user can open Settings → Categories to control which categories and subcategories appear and in what priority order, with changes saved automatically.
**Depends on**: Phase 10 (preference providers come from Phase 10)
**Requirements**: SETCAT-01, SETCAT-02, SETCAT-06, SETCAT-07, SETCAT-08, SETCAT-09, SETCAT-10, SETCAT-11
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. From SettingsScreen the user taps a "Categories" tile and lands on SettingsCategoriesScreen via the `/settings/categories` route.
  2. The screen lists categories sorted by priority (ascending, alphabetical for ties), each row showing the category icon, its locale-resolved name, a visibility switch, and a drag handle.
  3. Toggling a category's visibility switch auto-saves to `/user-category-preference`; tapping the row body navigates to `SettingsSubcategoriesScreen` for that category, which lists its subcategories with their own visibility switches saving to `/user-subcategory-preference`.
  4. Reordering categories via drag handle persists the new order via `POST /user-category-preference/reorder`; reordering subcategories persists via `POST /user-subcategory-preference/reorder`. Both reflect the saved order on reload, and a failed reorder reverts the list with an error toast.
  5. Turning off a category/subcategory that has the user's own trails shows a confirm dialog with the trail count and a link to view them before saving.

**Plans**: 4 plans

  - [x] 12-01-PLAN.md — Provider reorder methods + sort/visibility helpers + own-trail count helper + l10n keys
  - [x] 12-02-PLAN.md — SettingsCategoriesScreen: sorted list, visibility toggle, drag-handle reorder, own-trail confirm dialog
  - [x] 12-03-PLAN.md — SettingsSubcategoriesScreen: parent-scoped list + empty state, toggle, reorder, own-trail confirm dialog
  - [x] 12-04-PLAN.md — Settings "Categories" tile + go_router route wiring (SETCAT-01/02)

**UI hint**: yes

<details>
<summary>✅ v1.4 MapLibre Migration (Phases 13-18) — SHIPPED 2026-07-10</summary>

**Milestone Goal:** Replace the Flutter app's `flutter_map` + forked `vector_map_tiles`/`vector_tile_renderer` stack with the `maplibre` package, retiring both `flomp/*` forks and moving map rendering onto native GL — without ever leaving the app unbuildable and without regressing offline trail rendering.

- [x] **Phase 13: Glyph & Sprite Endpoint** - A unified `/map/style-sources` SvelteKit endpoint (replacing `/map/tileurl`) resolves tile, glyph, and sprite URLs in one object, under operator override (completed 2026-07-08)
- [x] **Phase 14: Coordinate Type Migration** - `latlong2.LatLng` → `Geographic`, `LatLngBounds` → `LngLatBounds`, test-guarded, before any map code moves (completed 2026-07-08)
- [x] **Phase 15: MapLibre Core, Trail Rendering & Offline Parity** - `WandererMap` on `MapLibreMap`; a downloaded trail renders basemap *and labels* in airplane mode (completed 2026-07-09)
- [x] **Phase 16: List & Map Screens on MapLibre** - Multi-trail list maps plus server-clustered map-screen search on native circle/symbol layers
- [x] **Phase 17: Navigation on MapLibre** - Heading-up follow, compass reset, location puck; the last `flutter_map` plugin call sites disappear (completed 2026-07-10)
- [x] **Phase 18: Retire flutter_map and the flomp Forks** - Both forks and all five packages leave `pubspec.yaml`; `maplibre` pinned (completed 2026-07-10)

#### Sequencing Rationale

Three hard constraints shape this order, and they are load-bearing rather than stylistic:

1. **The app builds and runs at every phase boundary.** `flutter_map` and `maplibre` coexist in `pubspec.yaml` from Phase 15 through Phase 17. Migration is screen-by-screen. Each phase's final success criterion asserts the un-migrated screens still render.

2. **Backend before the offline gate.** The glyph config endpoint (Phase 13) is a hard prerequisite for OFFL-04 — you cannot verify "a downloaded trail renders labels with no network" until the app has a stable URL (Wanderer-controlled, defaulting to Protomaps) to fetch and cache glyphs/sprites from. Phase 13 is SvelteKit config-route work and shares no code with Phase 14, so the two can execute in parallel; both gate Phase 15.

3. **Offline parity is a hard gate, and it forces Phase 15's size.** Today's offline path (`MultiPmTilesVectorTileProvider`) lives *inside* `wanderer_map.dart`. The moment `WandererMap` becomes a `MapLibreMap` (CORE-01), that path breaks — so `pmtiles://` (OFFL-03/05) must land in the same phase. And a downloaded trail that renders a basemap with no place names is a regression against today's bundled-font rendering, so `file://` glyphs (OFFL-01/02/04) must land there too. Phase 15 carries 20 requirements not by preference but because the offline gate cannot be deferred a phase without breaking it.

**Why the type migration is its own early phase (TYPE-01/02 → Phase 14).**
`Geographic(lon:, lat:)` reverses the argument order of `LatLng(lat, lon)`. A transposed coordinate is silent: no crash, no type error, just a track drawn in the wrong hemisphere. The affected files are GPX parsing and polyline decoding — trail *data*, not map rendering. Landing this change alone, guarded by the existing `gpx_util` / `polyline_util` tests and with `flutter_map` still rendering through boundary adapters, gives one unambiguous verification signal: *do the coordinates still come out identical?* Bundled into Phase 15, a transposed lat/lon would be indistinguishable from a maplibre camera bug.

The alternative — trailing the type change behind screen migration — was rejected: `Trail.gpxPoints` is consumed by every map screen, so flipping its type last would touch all remaining screens in one commit. That is precisely the big-bang cutover PROJECT.md rules out. The cost of going early is temporary `Geographic → LatLng` adapters at the four not-yet-migrated `flutter_map` call sites; each screen deletes its own adapter as it migrates.

**Watch for the late-closing "foundation" requirements.**
CORE-05 (`MapCompass`), CORE-06 (`animateCamera`/`fitBounds`), and CORE-07 (`enableLocation`/`trackLocation`) each read like foundation work but each *retires a file or a pubspec plugin*, and therefore cannot close until the last screen using it is migrated. `map_compass.dart` is imported by `map_screen`, `navigation_screen`, and `trail_detail_map_screen`; `AnimatedMapController` by `list_detail_map_screen`, `map_screen`, and `navigation_screen`; `CurrentLocationLayer` by `wanderer_map`, `map_screen`, and `navigation_screen`. In all three cases the last holdout is `navigation_screen`. All three are assigned to Phase 17. Earlier phases still swap their own call sites — they just cannot delete the file or drop the dependency.

### Phase 13: Glyph & Sprite Endpoint

**Goal**: The app resolves tile, glyph, and sprite URLs through a single Wanderer-controlled config endpoint, under the same operator override as tiles today — defaulting to Protomaps' public assets rather than self-hosting a copy.
**Depends on**: Nothing (Phase 12 complete; independent of Phase 14 — the two can run in parallel)
**Requirements**: GLYPH-01, GLYPH-02, GLYPH-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. A single `/api/v1/map/style-sources` endpoint replaces `/api/v1/map/tileurl` and returns the tile URL, the glyph URL template (`{fontstack}/{range}.pbf`), and the sprite base URL in one JSON object, defaulting to Protomaps' public `basemaps-assets` host for glyphs/sprite (the same URLs the app's theme references today) when no override is set.
  2. The returned glyph template resolves valid SDF glyph PBFs for `Noto Sans Regular`, `Noto Sans Medium`, `Noto Sans Italic`, and `Noto Sans Devanagari Regular v1` (the 4th fontstack the style's data-driven `text-font` expression uses), for every `{range}` the style's 14 symbol layers request. The returned sprite base resolves `sprite.json`, `sprite.png`, and `sprite@2x.png` (light and dark variants), indexing the `arrow` icon plus the route-network shield icons the style names.
  3. An operator sets one environment variable and the config endpoint returns glyph/sprite URLs pointing at their own host instead; unset, it returns the Protomaps default. Tile URL override behavior is unchanged from today's `TILE_SERVER_URL` handling, just served from the merged endpoint.
  4. The app (`tile_url_provider.dart` and its consumer `map_style_provider.dart`) is updated to fetch and parse the unified `/map/style-sources` response instead of `/map/tileurl`; tile URL resolution behaves identically to today, and the app on today's `flutter_map` stack still builds and runs untouched. No new Go/PocketBase routes, asset vendoring, or Docker build changes — this phase is SvelteKit + a small Flutter provider change only.

**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:

- [x] 13-01-PLAN.md — Unified `/api/v1/map/style-sources` endpoint (replaces `/map/tileurl`) + Flutter `MapConfig` provider fetch/parse

### Phase 14: Coordinate Type Migration

**Goal**: The app's trail, GPX, and position data speak maplibre's coordinate vocabulary, with the lat/lon argument-order swap isolated and test-guarded before any map code changes.
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent of Phase 13 — the two can run in parallel; both gate Phase 15)
**Requirements**: TYPE-01, TYPE-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Importing a GPX file produces coordinates identical to those produced before the migration — the existing `gpx_util` and `polyline_util` tests pass, extended with assertions that latitude and longitude are not transposed.
  2. A hiker opens any trail — detail, list, map, or navigation — and the track draws in exactly the same place it did before, still rendered by `flutter_map` through boundary adapters.
  3. `trail.dart`, `gpx_util.dart`, `polyline_util.dart`, and `foreground_position_stream_provider.dart` expose `Geographic` and `LngLatBounds`; no `latlong2.LatLng` survives in the data layer.
  4. The app builds and runs on the unchanged `flutter_map` stack.

**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 15: MapLibre Core, Trail Rendering & Offline Parity

**Goal**: `WandererMap` renders through `MapLibreMap`, and a hiker opening a trail — online, or downloaded with the device in airplane mode — sees basemap, place labels, icons, track, waypoints, and pins.
**Depends on**: Phase 13 (glyphs must exist to cache), Phase 14 (`Geographic` types)
**Requirements**: STYLE-01, STYLE-02, STYLE-03, STYLE-04, GLYPH-04, CORE-01, CORE-02, CORE-03, CORE-04, TRAIL-01, TRAIL-02, TRAIL-03, TRAIL-04, TRAIL-05, OFFL-01, OFFL-02, OFFL-03, OFFL-04, OFFL-05, OFFL-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. A hiker opens a trail's map and the Protomaps basemap renders through native GL from the operator's `TILE_SERVER_URL`; place-name labels render in all four Noto Sans fontstacks (incl. Devanagari), and the `arrow` and route-shield icons appear — icons the app silently drops today.
  2. The GPX track draws as a 5px route-colored line over a 2px white casing, with directional arrows along it; waypoints are tappable and animate on selection; start and finish pins render, nudged apart when they fall within 36 screen pixels; the elevation-profile marker tracks the hiker's scrub position.
  3. Switching the app between light and dark theme swaps the map style live; the initial camera fits the trail's bounds with the caller's padding; and every map shows a scale bar plus the Protomaps/OpenStreetMap attribution the app owes under ODbL and does not display today.
  4. **The offline gate.** With the device in airplane mode, a downloaded trail renders its basemap from `.pmtiles` via native `pmtiles://` — every cell, when the trail spans several — *and renders its place-name labels* from `file://` glyphs cached at download time. Downloading a second trail reuses the cached glyphs and sprite instead of re-fetching them.
  5. ~~`lib/vendor/vector_map_tiles/pm_tile_provider.dart` is deleted~~ **CORRECTED during 15-06 execution:** this criterion contradicted itself — `navigation_screen`'s offline flutter_map path consumes `MultiPmTilesVectorTileProvider` from that exact file, so deleting it here would break the same screen this criterion requires to keep building. OFFL-06 (deletion) is deferred to Phase 17/18, when `navigation_screen` migrates off flutter_map and stops needing it. The actual criterion 5: the app still builds and runs with `flutter_map` serving `list_detail_map_screen`, `list_detail_screen`, `map_screen`, and `navigation_screen` — **met**.

**Plans**: 6 plans

Plans:

- [x] 15-01-PLAN.md — Throwaway `file://` glyph+sprite resolution spike (risk gate, physical-device verify)
- [x] 15-02-PLAN.md — Style extraction to `.json` assets + `mapStyleJsonProvider` (STYLE-01..04)
- [x] 15-03-PLAN.md — App-wide glyph/sprite cache + path-safety + download trigger (GLYPH-04, OFFL-01)
- [x] 15-04-PLAN.md — `WandererMap` on `MapLibreMap`: camera, live theme swap, chrome, markers (CORE-01..04, TRAIL-05)
- [x] 15-05-PLAN.md — Trail track/casing, static arrows, waypoint/pin markers (TRAIL-01..04)
- [x] 15-06-PLAN.md — Offline rewrite (`pmtiles://file://` + `file://`), multi-cell decision, delete vendor provider (OFFL-02..06)

**Risk gate**: This phase retires the milestone's highest-risk unknown — whether maplibre-native resolves `file://` glyph URLs for offline label rendering. Nothing downstream is safe until criterion 4 passes on a physical device in airplane mode. The first plan of this phase should be a throwaway spike proving `file://` glyph resolution against a hand-built style, *before* the phase invests in trail rendering or download-time caching. If maplibre-native rejects `file://`, the milestone needs a different offline-label strategy and this roadmap needs revision.
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 16: List & Map Screens on MapLibre

**Goal**: The browse surfaces run on maplibre — a list's trails on one fitted map, and the map screen's trail search rendered from the server's cluster endpoint as native layers.
**Depends on**: Phase 15
**Requirements**: CORE-08, CLUS-01, CLUS-02, CLUS-03, CLUS-04, CLUS-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. A hiker opens a list and sees every trail in it drawn on one `MapLibreMap`, with the camera animating to fit all of them; the list detail screen's inline map does the same.
  2. Panning or zooming the map screen re-queries `POST /search/trails/cluster` at the new bounds and zoom, debounced exactly as today, and the returned FeatureCollection renders as native circle layers sized by `point_count` and labelled from `point_count_abbreviated`, matching web's `ClusterLayer` step ramp.
  3. Tapping a cluster zooms the camera toward it; tapping an unclustered point selects that trail and fits the camera to its polyline.
  4. Hiding a category or subcategory in Settings → Categories changes which trails the map screen returns, because the endpoint applies the preference filters server-side.
  5. The app builds and runs; `navigation_screen` still renders on `flutter_map`.

**Plans**: 3 plans (2 waves)

- [x] 16-01-PLAN.md — Lightweight SearchMap host + list maps on MapLibre (CORE-08)
- [x] 16-02-PLAN.md — Cluster search provider + verbatim native cluster layers (CLUS-01/02/04/05)
- [x] 16-03-PLAN.md — Map screen wiring: cluster rendering, category-icon markers, native tap handling (CLUS-01..05)

**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 17: Navigation on MapLibre

**Goal**: Turn-by-turn navigation runs on maplibre with heading-up follow, compass reset, and a live location puck — and the last `flutter_map` plugin call sites disappear from `lib/`.
**Depends on**: Phase 16
**Requirements**: NAV-01, NAV-02, NAV-03, NAV-04, CORE-05, CORE-06, CORE-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. A hiker taps Navigate and the route line, their location puck, and heading-up follow render on `MapLibreMap`; maneuver instructions advance as they move along the trail.
  2. Dragging the map during navigation breaks follow mode and the recenter control restores it, matching today's `MapEventMoveStart` / `dragStart` behavior; the compass control animates the bearing back to north.
  3. With the device offline, navigation still serves maneuvers from the ObjectBox cache and shows the offline indicator — v1.1 behavior, unregressed.
  4. The location puck and follow mode come from maplibre's `enableLocation` / `trackLocation`, camera moves from native `animateCamera` / `fitBounds`, and the compass from maplibre's built-in `MapCompass`. `lib/components/map/map_compass.dart` is deleted, and no `AnimatedMapController` or `CurrentLocationLayer` reference remains anywhere in `lib/`.

**Plans**: 3 plans (3 waves)

Plans:

- [x] 17-01-PLAN.md — Migrate navigation_screen to ml.MapLibreMap: native puck/follow, compass toggle, breadcrumb, offline pmtiles (NAV-01/02/03, CORE-06/07)
- [x] 17-02-PLAN.md — Delete map_compass.dart + pm_tile_provider.dart, strip legacy TrailLayer, restore trail-detail compass (CORE-05, OFFL-06)
- [x] 17-03-PLAN.md — On-device checkpoint: drag-break precision, follow, compass, offline navigation (NAV-01/02/03/04, CORE-07)

**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 18: Retire flutter_map and the flomp Forks

**Goal**: The forks and the old map stack leave the project — the milestone's primary payoff — and `maplibre` is pinned against its pre-1.0 breaking-change cadence.
**Depends on**: Phase 17 (every map surface migrated)
**Requirements**: CLEAN-01, CLEAN-02, CLEAN-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. `flutter_map`, `flutter_map_animations`, `flutter_map_location_marker`, and `flutter_map_marker_cluster` are absent from `pubspec.yaml`, and `flutter pub deps` shows none of them anywhere in the dependency tree.
  2. `vector_map_tiles` and `vector_tile_renderer` are absent from `pubspec.yaml`, and `dependency_overrides` no longer names either `flomp/*` fork — the app builds from published packages only.
  3. `maplibre` is pinned to an exact version rather than a caret range, so `flutter pub upgrade` cannot pull a breaking 0.x minor.
  4. A hiker walks every map surface — trail detail, trail map, list, list map, map screen, navigation — online and in airplane mode, and each renders as it did before the migration began.

**Plans**: 3 plans (3 waves)

Plans:

- [x] 18-01-PLAN.md — Sever source deps: relocate effectiveBrightness, local LocationMarkerPosition/ServiceDisabledException classes, delete 4 dead fork/adapter files (CLEAN-01/02 prep)
- [x] 18-02-PLAN.md — Remove 6 packages + 2 flomp overrides from pubspec.yaml, pin maplibre 0.3.5 exact, whole-package analyze/deps/test gate (CLEAN-01/02/03)
- [x] 18-03-PLAN.md — On-device regression walk of all six map surfaces, online and airplane mode (CLEAN-01/02/03 verify)

<summary>✅ v1.8 Offline Recording & Deferred Upload (Phases 33-36, 38, 38.1) — SHIPPED 2026-08-07</summary>

**Milestone Goal:** A hiker who records a trail or imports a GPX with no signal can save it, review it, and fill in its details on the spot — and it uploads itself when the phone next has a connection, without the hiker doing anything.

- [x] **Phase 33: Conversion Correctness** (5/5 plans) — completed 2026-07-31
- [x] **Phase 34: Dart Conversion Port** (7/7 plans) — completed 2026-08-01
- [x] **Phase 35: Offline Trail Creation** (executed without plans) — completed 2026-08-02
- [x] **Phase 36: Local-First Recording & Automatic Upload** (21/21 plans) — completed 2026-08-03
- [x] **Phase 38: Downloaded Trails as State, Not Objects** (6/6 plans) — completed 2026-08-04
- [x] **Phase 38.1: Downloaded-Trail Blocker Closure (INSERTED)** (5/5 plans) — completed 2026-08-05

Phases 38 and 38.1 were scoped as post-v1.8 work but executed before the milestone closed, and
were claimed by v1.8 at close. Phase 38.1 was inserted to close the three blockers `38-REVIEW.md`
found against a false premise Phase 38 inherited from Phase 36.

See `.planning/milestones/v1.8-ROADMAP.md` for full details.

## Unscheduled

Phases below are **not part of any milestone yet**. They are parked here rather than in the
backlog because their scope is already understood at file level. When the next milestone is
opened, `/gsd-new-milestone` should claim them explicitly.

### Phase 37: Way Types & Surfaces Breakdown (mobile-first)

**Goal**: A hiker looking at any trail sees what they will actually be walking on — a stacked
breakdown of way types (path, footpath, track, road…) and surfaces (paved, gravel, dirt,
unpaved…) with distance per category, including off-road alpine paths that naive map-matching
silently drops.
**Milestone**: none — **explicitly NOT part of v1.8 (Offline Recording & Deferred Upload)**.
This is online-only trail enrichment and shares no requirement with REC-*/SYNC-*.
**Depends on**: Phase 36 complete — a hard sequencing constraint, not a preference. See the
file-conflict note below.
**Requirements**: TBD (derive from `.planning/todos/pending/2026-07-18-way-types-and-surfaces-breakdown.md`)
**Plans**: 0 plans

**⚠ File conflict with Phase 36 — do not execute concurrently.** Three surfaces are edited by
both:

- `app/lib/models/trail.dart` — 36-01 (done) and **36-07 (not yet executed)** both modify it.
  Phase 37 adds a `way_type_surface` field plus two new freezed classes to the same file; both
  sides regenerate `*.freezed.dart` / `*.g.dart`, so concurrent work collides in generated
  output, not just in source.

- `web/src/routes/api/v1/trail/+server.ts` (and `[id]/+server.ts`) — Phase 36's SYNC-04
  idempotency work reshapes the trail save path; Phase 37 wants to hook way-type computation
  into the same create/update handlers.

- `db/migrations/` — Phase 36 adds owner/sync-state fields to trail storage; Phase 37 adds a
  `way_type_surface` json field to the same `trails` collection (`e864strfxo14pm4`). Two
  migrations against one collection must land in a known order.

- `app/lib/components/trail/trail_panel.dart` — Phase 36's gap-closure plan 36-12 (Task 3)
  rewrites three `context.push` sites here to re-target the map route for unsynced trails.

Clean (no Phase 36 plan touches them): `app/lib/theme/colors.dart`, `web/src/lib/server/`.

**Source material:** the todo carries a complete file-level implementation plan, including the
verified root cause — Valhalla's default `pedestrian` costing caps `max_hiking_difficulty ≈ 1`,
excluding `sac_scale >= mountain_hiking` paths from the routable graph, which is why the earlier
POC dropped off-road segments (OSM way 39669166: 16 m matched by default vs 1.09 km with
`max_hiking_difficulty: 6`). Full research: `37-RESEARCH-SOURCE.md` in this phase's directory.

**Deferred follow-up:** the SvelteKit web rendering of the same persisted field is a separate,
smaller phase — not part of Phase 37.

Plans:

- [ ] TBD (run /gsd-plan-phase 37 to break down)

### Phase 39: Unified Tile Model — Retire the Offline/Online Split

**Goal**: A hiker who opens a trail map with no service and then walks back into coverage watches
the map fill in — no reopening, no backgrounding, no stuck offline basemap. Coverage degrades and
recovers per tile, per area, instead of the whole map flipping between two modes.
**Milestone**: none — parked for v1.9 claiming. Independent of Phase 37 (way types is online-only
trail enrichment and shares no surface of consequence; see the conflict note below).
**Depends on**: nothing outstanding. Phases 38 / 38.1 (downloaded trails as state) are complete,
and this phase builds directly on the `TileProxyServer` they left in place.
**Requirements**: none mapped — this phase's coverage contract is the 17 locked decisions D-01..D-17 in `39-CONTEXT.md`
**Plans**: 9 plans in 7 waves

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. **The recovery case.** A hiker opens a trail map in airplane mode, sees the downloaded
     basemap, then regains service — and online tiles appear around the downloaded region
     *on the same screen*, on the next pan or zoom, without navigating away or reopening the
     trail. **Revised 2026-09-09:** originally worded as automatic fill-in with no interaction.
     On-device testing rejected the mechanism that would have delivered that (see the risk-gate
     note below), and the developer accepted user-initiated recovery instead. The defect the
     phase exists to kill is that *nothing* on the screen could bring online tiles back — with
     the offline style every tile pointed at the proxy with no upstream, so panning into
     uncovered area was blank forever. Redirect-on-miss kills that on its own. Accepted
     limitation: the gesture-disabled embedded map in `trail_panel.dart` recovers only on
     remount.

  2. **No offline regression.** With the device in airplane mode, a downloaded trail still
     renders basemap, place-name labels, icons and hillshade at every zoom the map allows —
     including above the local pmtiles depth, via overzoom rather than blank tiles.

  3. **The split is gone, not patched.** `TrailMap` has no `offline` parameter and
     `NavigationScreen` no `isOffline`; one style is composed on one code path, with a single
     style-JSON provider. `TrailMap(offline: trail.isOffline)` — the conflation of "downloaded"
     with "no connectivity" documented at `app/lib/models/trail.dart:110-116` — is no longer
     expressible.

  4. **No blank-forever tiles.** A tile that failed while the device was offline is re-requested
     once service returns. Specifically: the proxy never answers a retryable tile with 404,
     because MapLibre persists `noContent` as an empty tile row and never retries `NotFound`.

  5. **The cache survives a cold start.** Tiles fetched in one app run are served from MapLibre's
     ambient cache after the app is killed and relaunched — which requires the loopback port to be
     stable across launches while remaining unguessable to a co-resident app.

  6. **No thermal regression while panning.** Online tile bytes must not start transiting the root
     isolate; panning cost stays at or below today's measured profile.

**Risk gate — RESOLVED 2026-09-09, outcome: no automatic recovery.** The gate asked whether a
`setConnected(false)` → `setConnected(true)` pulse could force MapLibre to retry Connection-failed
requests. Tested on a physical Android device: **it cannot.** The pulse fires correctly (2ms channel
round trip, `result.success(null)`, no exceptions) and MapLibre re-schedules nothing — 82
Connection-class tile failures before, **zero** tile requests after. The failures are errored
entries in the source's tile pyramid, not pending requests, so a connectivity edge has nothing to
act on. Full evidence in `39-01-SUMMARY.md` `## Risk gate outcome`.

The documented `setStyle` fallback was then **declined** as disproportionate (it rebuilds every
source, layer and image, dropping the navigation screen's trail track and breadcrumb on each
regain). Recovery is user-initiated instead — see criterion 1 and CONTEXT.md D-12a. The dead pulse
code is removed by Plan 09 (D-12b).

The gate also had to run *after* Plan 03 rather than before it: until redirect-on-miss existed,
every tile pointed at loopback — reachable even in airplane mode — so no Connection-class failure
could occur to test against. See `39-SEQUENCING-NOTE.md`.

**Incidental confirmation:** the on-device DNS failures for `api.protomaps.com` prove MapLibre
Native follows the 302 from loopback to the CDN on real hardware — the architecture's single
load-bearing assumption, previously verified only from source.

**Source material:** `39-RESEARCH-SOURCE.md` in this phase's directory carries the complete
design and the MapLibre Native research behind it — each finding marked CONFIRMED or UNCERTAIN,
with file+symbol citations. Load-bearing conclusions:

- **302 redirect on a coverage miss is viable.** MapLibre Native follows 3xx on tile requests on
  both platforms, verified for Android against the shipped `13.0.3-pre0` AAR. Redirecting (rather
  than reverse-proxying bytes) is what keeps online tiles off the root isolate — see criterion 6.

- **Never 404 a retryable tile.** `noContent` is persisted as an empty tile row and `NotFound`
  backs off to `Duration::max()`. An earlier draft of this design had the proxy 404 when offline;
  that would have reproduced the original bug in a more durable form. Do not reintroduce it.

- **A stable loopback port is a prerequisite, not a nice-to-have.** The ambient cache keys on
  `resource.url` — the loopback URL — and the proxy binds an ephemeral port today, so the cache is
  orphaned on every cold start. This already makes the `max-age=86400` at
  `tile_proxy_server.dart:203-206` useless across launches; unification turns it into a real data
  and battery regression. Persist the port at install and add a per-install secret path segment to
  preserve the unguessability property `tile_proxy_server.dart:29-32` deliberately chose.

- **`MainActivity.kt`'s comment becomes false.** It justifies the `setConnected(true)` pin with
  "offline styles never carry an online URL to (fail to) reach." This phase deletes that premise;
  the comment must be rewritten, not left standing.

- **Scope boundary:** CDN-fetched tiles are *not* captured for durable offline use. Downloaded
  regions stay the only promised offline coverage, so "downloaded" keeps meaning exactly one
  thing in the regions UI. No writable tile store, no eviction policy, no storage-usage screen.

**Phase 37 overlap (minor, not a blocker):** both touch
`app/lib/components/trail/trail_panel.dart` — Phase 39 only deletes an argument at line 159.
Phase 39 reads but does not modify `app/lib/models/trail.dart`, so there is no generated-output
collision of the kind Phase 37 has with Phase 36. Sequence either way.

**UI hint**: no — no new surfaces; this removes a mode rather than adding a screen.
Plans:
**Wave 1**

- [x] 39-01-PLAN.md — Android `setConnected` pulse behind a platform channel, rewritten `MainActivity` comment, and the on-device risk gate (D-12/13/14)
- [x] 39-02-PLAN.md — persisted proxy identity (stable random port + per-install secret) and persisted `/map/style-sources` (D-05/06/09)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*

- [x] 39-03-PLAN.md — proxy binds the persisted port behind the secret path segment and answers a coverage miss with 302, never 404 (D-02/03/04/05/06/07)

**Wave 3** *(blocked on Wave 2 completion)*

- [x] 39-04-PLAN.md — proxy serves glyphs and sprites local-first with write-through into `map_cache` (D-11 server half)

**Wave 4** *(blocked on Wave 3 completion)*

- [x] 39-05-PLAN.md — `rewriteStyleForProxy` becomes the sole transform: loopback-only URLs, no cache root, maxzoom pins kept (D-01/08/11)

**Wave 5** *(blocked on Wave 4 completion)*

- [x] 39-06-PLAN.md — delete `TrailMap.offline` and its three call-site arguments (D-16)
- [x] 39-07-PLAN.md — delete `NavigationScreen.isOffline` and every route/resume value that fed it (D-16)

**Wave 6** *(blocked on Wave 5 completion)*

- [ ] 39-08-PLAN.md — collapse to one style provider, retire the legacy N-cell transform, rename the file to match (D-10/17)

**Wave 7** *(blocked on Wave 6 completion)*

- [ ] 39-09-PLAN.md — connectivity-regain re-probe, fire the recovery mechanism, verify criteria 1/2/5/6 on device (D-15/12/03)

## Progress

**Execution Order:**
Phases 13 and 14 are independent and may execute in either order or in parallel; 15-27 are strictly sequential:

```
13 ─┐
    ├─→ 15 → 16 → 17 → 18 → 19 → 20 → 21 → 22 → 23 → 24 → 25 → 26 → 27
14 ─┘
```

v1.7 continues from Phase 27. Phase 29 and Phase 30 both depend only on Phase 28 and may execute in parallel; Phase 31 depends specifically on Phase 29. Phase 32 revises Phase 28's seeding approach and changes Phase 29's `buildRegion`, so it follows both:

```
28 ─┬─→ 29 ─┬─→ 31
    │       └─→ 32
    └─→ 30
```

v1.8 continued from Phase 32. Phases 33-36 were strictly sequential — each phase's success
criteria depended on groundwork the previous phase laid. Phases 38 and 38.1 were scoped as
post-v1.8 bug work but executed before the milestone closed, and were claimed by v1.8 at close;
38.1 is a gap-closure phase inserted after `38-REVIEW.md` found three blockers:

```
33 → 34 → 35 → 36 → 38 → 38.1 → (v1.8 ships)
```

Phase 37 remains unscheduled. It is **not parallelizable with the v1.8 work** — it edits
`app/lib/models/trail.dart`, the `api/v1/trail` handlers, and the `trails` collection migrations,
all of which Phase 36 also touched. It is now unblocked and awaits a milestone.
