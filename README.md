## Getting started
The recommended and quickest way to install wanderer is using docker compose:

``` bash
# download the docker compose file
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flomp/wanderer/main/docker-compose.yml

# build and launch via docker compose
docker compose up -d
```

The first startup can take up to 90 seconds after which you can access the frontend at localhost:3000.

> ℹ️ if you are not hosting wanderer at http://localhost:3000 make sure to change ORIGIN variable. Otherwise you will run into CORS errors.

> ⚠️ if you are using wanderer in a production environment make sure to change the MEILI_MASTER_KEY variable.

You can also run wanderer on bare-metal. Check out the [documentation](https://wanderer.to/getting-started/installation/#from-source) for a detailed how-to guide.
